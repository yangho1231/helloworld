# transcend-react

React components and whatnot that transcend multiple projects

## Developing

Since this package also includes documentation, it depends on itself. After cloning, `cd transcend-react` and:

    npm link # this sets up a symlink from here to the global node_modules folder
    npm link transcend-react # this symlinks back to the current package as if it were installed to the local node_modules folder

Then build project:

    npm run watch

And serve the docs locally:

    npm start

## Releasing

Do the version bump on your feature branch. Probably worth rebasing on master first to make sure your are bumping up to the right version. Don't tag your commit, `make release` will take care of tagging and pushing the new tag after it successfully updates the package registry.

Once your feature branch lands on master:

    git checkout master
    git pull
    make release

## Updating online docs

1. Make a new branch from updated master
2. `npm run build-examples`
3. Commit and pull request
